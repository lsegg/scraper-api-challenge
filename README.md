# Scraper API and CLI

This is a step by step guide on how to use this simple data extraction package which supports CLI and API requests.

## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - Promise based HTTP client
- [Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/) - Library for parsing and manipulating HTML
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Web framework for Node.js
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - JavaScript Testing Framework
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime environment
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Package manager for Node.js

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

1. Run `npm i` to install the package dependencies.

## CLI Usage ‚úÖ

Run:

```
  node cli-scraper.js <htmlSource> <selectorSource>
```

- _htmlSource_ can either be an html file or a web URl.
- _selectorSource_ is a JSON of keys with css selectors as values.
- In case of repetitive data, the property _\_\_root_ is required.

E.g. `node cli-scraper.js examples/input1.html examples/selector1.json`

The results will be logged in the console and written in the _scrapedData.json_ file inside the examples folder.

## API Usage ‚úÖ

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the server.
2. Use curl, postman or another API testing tool to make your API requests.
3. The HTTP method should be POST and the body should be a JSON with html and selectors properties:

- _html_ can either be an html file stringified or a web URl.
- _selectors_ is an object of keys with css selectors as values.
- In case of repetitive data, the property _\_\_root_ is required.

E.g.

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/scrape -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"html": "https://github.com/", "selectors": {"title": "h1:first-child"}}'
```

## Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- A text editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- An API testing platform like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

## Notes üìã

- I based my libraries decision on most popular and downloaded npm options.
- The first example provided in the challenge description is wrong since there's no "p" element child of "h1"
- The second example provided in the challenge description was modified to include tbody because of the cheerio load function [behaviour](https://cheerio.js.org/docs/basics/loading#load)
